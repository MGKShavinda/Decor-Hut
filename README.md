I'm so proud to announce that I just created my first webpage using HTML and CSS! This website is made for as a University project in 2022. It was such a great learning experience. I used Html and css languages for develop this website. I had the chance to learn about basic web development concepts, such as structure, styling, layout and design. It gave me an understanding of how websites are built from scratch with code. Additionally, it taught me valuable skills that can be applied in many other areas of programming and coding. Overall it was a fun journey that has given me more confidence when working on future projects!
Despite making some mistakes such as not designing the UI to be responsive and having issues with HTML/CSS, I was able to gain valuable insight into web development.
